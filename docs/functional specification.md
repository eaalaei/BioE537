# Functional Specification for Microfluidic System Simulator

## Users and Knowledge
The intended users of the Microfluidic System Simulator include researchers and scientists working with microfluidic systems, particularly in lab-on-a-chip and organ-on-a-chip applications. Users are assumed to have a background in biology or related fields but may lack expertise in computational fluid dynamics.

## Information Users Want
Users seek information about the flow dynamics in microfluidic systems, tissue permeabilities, and the effects of shear stress on cells. The software aims to assist users in identifying tissues subjected to flow, simulating fluid dynamics, and determining the acceptable range of fluid velocities for maintaining cell viability.

## Use Cases
1. **Identifying Tissues Subjected to Flow:**
   - Users can input tissue characteristics to visualize the areas subjected to flow using the fluid dynamics simulation.
